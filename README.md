# Time-Based Greeting
This is a simple JavaScript web page that displays a greeting based on the current time of day. It uses the local system time to determine whether to say "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening".

## 🔍 About

The greeting is determined using basic JavaScript:
- `Date()` to get the current hour
- Conditional statements to choose the message
- Output is displayed directly on the web page

This project is perfect for beginners learning how to use JavaScript with HTML.
